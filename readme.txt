Adds an interface to the Hybrid Settings page to change the byline settings.

== Description ==

<em>Hybrid Byline</em> is a plugin that adds a frontend interface to the Hybrid Settings page for users of the Hybrid theme to change the byline settings.

By default, the plugin reflects the existing byline settings that Hybrid uses. It gives you the ability to add categories or the number of comments to your post byline. You can add the author and date to pages as well. One extra 
addition is that you can choose to add `nofollow` to the post author link (a possible SEO benefit).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hybrid-byline` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
